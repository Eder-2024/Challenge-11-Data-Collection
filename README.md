# 🚀 **Mars Rover Data Analysis** 🌌

Welcome to the **Mars Rover Data Analysis** project! This analysis explores temperature and atmospheric pressure data collected by NASA's **Curiosity Rover** on Mars. We aim to understand Martian weather patterns, estimate the Martian year length, and identify the coldest and hottest months on the Red Planet. 🌍🪐

---

## 📊 **Key Insights**

- **12 Months on Mars**: Mars has 12 months, just like Earth, but with different durations.
- **1867 Martian Days (Sols)**: The dataset contains data for 1867 sols, giving us rich insights into Mars' climate.
- **Coldest and Hottest Months**:  
  - **Coldest**: Month **3** (-83.31°C).  
  - **Hottest**: Month **8** (-68.38°C).  
- **Pressure Trends**:  
  - **Highest Pressure**: Month **9** (913.31 Pa).  
  - **Lowest Pressure**: Month **6** (745.05 Pa).  
- **Martian Year Length**: A Martian year is roughly **687 Earth days**.

## 🔍 **Analysis Breakdown**

- **Temperature**: Analyzed by Martian month to determine the coldest and hottest months.
- **Pressure**: Studied by month to identify fluctuations in atmospheric pressure.
- **Martian Year**: Estimated at **687 Earth days**, using temperature data over time.
